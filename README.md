# Run project

First of all you need to check if you have the Git system installed.

Then input following command in a comfortable directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/NazaryiMontytskyi/JavaDevelopLab3
```

Then you need to join to appropriate folder to run the project. So that you need to input:
```
cd JavaDevelopLab3/src
```

To get our program workable we need to compile the project. So that run following command:
```
javac App.java
```

In the exact program you don't need to do something. You just need to run the project and to see the result. To run the program execute following command:
```
java App.java
```
